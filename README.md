# willow-rs

> Protocols for synchronisable data stores. The best parts? Fine-grained permissions, a keen approach to privacy, destructive edits, and a dainty bandwidth and memory footprint.

Eventually, this repo will house Rust implementations of

- The [Willow Data Model](https://willowprotocol.org/specs/data-model/index.html#data_model), a mutable eventually-consistent store with improved deletion,
- [Willow Sideloading protocol](https://willowprotocol.org/specs/sideloading/index.html#sideloading), eventually consistent data delivered by any means possible,
- [Meadowcap](https://willowprotocol.org/specs/meadowcap/index.html#meadowcap), a capability system configurable to different social contexts,
- and [Willow General Purpose Sync Protocol](https://willowprotocol.org/specs/sync/index.html#sync), private and efficient synchronisation of Willow stores,

probably implemented in that order.

We welcome contributions! If you're looking for contribution ideas, please see the repo's issues, milestones, and projects.
